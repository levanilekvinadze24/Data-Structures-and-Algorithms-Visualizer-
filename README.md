# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer 🎨✨


The goal of this project is to **make understanding algorithms and data structures easy and interactive**.  
You can **enter your own inputs** to test how the algorithms and data structures work behind the scenes.  
Also, you can **control the animation speed** 🐢⚡ to focus and follow each step more clearly.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Input your own values** to see how they behave in different structures and sorting/searching algorithms.
- **Adjust animation speed** to better visualize each operation.
- **Friendly UI** designed to make learning fun and smooth!

## 📚 Currently Available

- Stack 📦
- Merge Sort 🌀

> More coming soon!
